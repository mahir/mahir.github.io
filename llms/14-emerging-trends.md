## 1. Agentic AI — From Pilots to Production

**23% of companies** use agentic AI today; within two years, **74%** will.

- **62%** are at least experimenting with AI agents (McKinsey)
- **85%** plan to customize agents — not use off-the-shelf solutions
- Top use cases: customer support, supply chain, marketing, IT service desk
- Only **21%** have mature governance for autonomous agents
- Market projected: **$8.5B (2026) → $45B (2030)**

> BCG: "future-built" companies allocate 15% of their AI budgets to agents. Laggards allocate near-zero.

## 2. Open Standards and Interoperability

**Dec 9, 2025:** Anthropic, OpenAI, and Block co-founded the Agentic AI Foundation.

- **MCP**: 97M+ monthly SDK downloads, 10,000+ active servers, adopted by all major platforms
- **AGENTS.md**: adopted by 60,000+ open-source projects since Aug 2025
- Platinum members: AWS, Anthropic, Block, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI
- The industry chose interoperability over lock-in

> Mike Krieger (Anthropic CPO): "It's become the industry standard for connecting AI systems to data and tools."

## 3. Efficiency and Sustainability

**Smaller, cheaper models are becoming strategically important.**

Teams are investing in optimized models (distilled, quantized, specialized) that deliver strong performance at lower cost and energy use. This makes AI more deployable: on-device, in real-time systems, and across more products where latency and cost matter.

## 4. Physical AI

**58% of companies** already use physical AI in operations; projected to reach **80%** within two years.

- **Digital twins** cited as highest-impact application (25%), followed by collaborative robotics (24%)
- Manufacturing, logistics, and defense lead adoption
- Drug discovery: AI compressing 10–15 year timelines; Insilico Medicine entered Phase 1 in <18 months
- Physical AI requires different governance — equipment safety, liability, maintenance

## 5. Sovereign AI

**AI procurement is being reshaped by geopolitics.**

- **83%** of companies view sovereign AI as at least moderately important
- **77%** now factor country of origin into vendor selection
- Nearly **60%** build AI stacks primarily with local vendors
- Only 11% of Americas companies rely on foreign-sourced AI (vs. 32% in EMEA)

## 6. Where to Start — A Decision Framework

### Tier 1 (start here)
Coding assistance, customer service augmentation, clinical documentation, content generation

### Tier 2 (scale next)
Sales enablement, contract analysis, knowledge management, billing automation

### Tier 3 (invest cautiously)
Drug discovery, autonomous multi-agent systems, creative R&D

**Selection criteria:** tight feedback loops, measurable outputs, high task frequency, existing data

**Red flags:** no baseline metrics, no workflow redesign plan, no escalation path to humans, no governance model
