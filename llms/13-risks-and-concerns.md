## The AI Impact Gap

88% of organizations use AI, but only **6% qualify as "high performers"** — and the gap is widening.

- Only **39%** report any EBIT impact at the enterprise level
- Just **25%** have moved 40%+ of AI pilots into production
- **64%** say AI enables innovation, but only **34%** are truly reimagining their business
- BCG: "future-built" companies (5%) see **6.2% revenue growth** from AI; laggards get **1.2%**

> The competitive advantage belongs to organizations that redesign workflows — not just deploy tools.

## Why Scaling Stalls

**Workflow redesign** is the #1 predictor of enterprise AI impact — bigger than governance, leadership, or tool selection.

- Only **21%** of organizations have fundamentally redesigned workflows for AI
- AI skills gap is the **#1 barrier** to integration (Deloitte)
- Only **14%** of frontline workers have received AI-related training (BCG)
- **60%** of workers with AI access use it daily — unchanged from last year despite expanded access
- High performers set **growth AND innovation** goals for AI — not just efficiency

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality |
|--------------|---------|
| "AI will replace X jobs" | Hybrid models outperform full replacement in every documented case |
| "More spend = more impact" | Workflow redesign matters more than tool budget |
| "We just need better models" | "The hard problems aren't model problems anymore" (Menlo Ventures) |
| "Deploy everywhere" | High performers narrow focus to highest-ROI domains |
| "Pilot success = scale success" | Most organizations stall between pilot and production |
| "Cost savings = transformation" | Efficiency gains alone don't create competitive advantage |

## Questions to Think About...

1. How do we maintain human agency in decisions when AI assistance becomes ubiquitous?

2. Where is the line between decision support and decision surrender?

3. How can bias be identified and counteracted?

4. What responsibilities do developers vs. users have?

5. In what situations might it be better **not** to use an LLM?

6. Is your organization redesigning workflows — or bolting AI onto processes designed for a pre-AI world?
