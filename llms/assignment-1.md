# The Prompt Engineering Bake-Off

**Time:** 20 minutes | **Teams:** 5–6 people | **Tools:** Any LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)

---

## The Setup

Every team gets the **same business problem** and the **same bad starter prompt**. Your job is to engineer a dramatically better prompt using techniques from today's lecture.

This mirrors the Etsy example we saw earlier — where prompt engineering alone took accuracy from 45% to 90%+.

---

## The Problem

You are the Head of Growth at **Canopy** — a new direct-to-consumer brand launching a **$4.99 premium plant-based protein bar** targeting Gen Z fitness enthusiasts (ages 18–27). You have $200K for launch. You need a 90-day go-to-market plan.

## The Starter Prompt (v1)

Start with this exact prompt — copy-paste it and note the output quality:

```
Write a go-to-market plan for a new protein bar.
```

**Save the v1 output. You'll need it for comparison.**

---

## Your Challenge

Iterate on the prompt at least **3 times**, applying techniques from today's lecture. The goal is the sharpest, most actionable output you can get.

### Techniques to try (use at least 2):
- **Persona / role assignment** — Who is the LLM acting as?
- **Structured output** — Specify the format you want back
- **Few-shot examples** — Show what a good answer looks like
- **Chain-of-Thought** — Ask for step-by-step reasoning
- **Constraints** — Budget limits, channel restrictions, timeline phases
- **Self-critique** — Ask the LLM to evaluate and improve its own output

---

## Deliverable

Submit **one slide** (Google Slides, Notion, or screenshot) containing:

| Section | What to include |
|---------|----------------|
| **v1 output** | A screenshot or key excerpt of the naive prompt's output |
| **Final prompt** | Your best prompt (the actual text) |
| **Final output** | The key excerpt of your best output |
| **Techniques used** | Which 2–3 techniques made the biggest difference |
| **Biggest insight** | One sentence: what surprised you about the iteration process? |

---

## How We'll Judge

The best outputs will be **specific, not generic**. Compare:

> **Generic (bad):** "Leverage social media influencers to build brand awareness"

> **Specific (good):** "Partner with 15 micro-influencers (10K–50K followers) in CrossFit and climbing niches on TikTok. Budget: $30K for month 1. Target: 500K impressions and 2% conversion to sampling program."

## Presentation (5 min)

2–3 volunteer teams show their **v1 vs. final output** side by side. Class reacts to the quality gap.
