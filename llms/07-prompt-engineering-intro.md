## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering refers to the process of crafting instructions that guide an AI model to generate the desired output. It is one of the most common model adaptation techniques and does not require changing a model's weights, unlike fine-tuning. Instead, it leverages the model's inherent capabilities through well-structured prompts.

## What is Prompt Engineering? (Simplified)

**Prompt** = instructions you give an AI model.

**Prompt Engineering** = crafting inputs that reliably yield useful outputs.

**Analogy:** Writing a recipe → AI cooks the dish.

### Example

- **Naive prompt:** "Write a poem about dogs."

- **Engineered prompt:** "Write a 12-line humorous poem about dogs, in Dr. Seuss style, with ABAB rhyme."
