She is currently finishing her Bachelor’s degree in (de)Fine-Art at Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam with her focus on Future Narrative. In March 2021, Hirtenfelder joined the Ars Electronica Futurelab as an intern but quickly took the opportunity to lead her first project where she explores future narratives with children.

Regarding her works, Hirtenfelder encounters a commercial perspective of Fine-Arts and focuses on the relation between the next economy of artists and the challenges they face as members of the creative industry.

If the Futurelab was to be a person, they would be in my eyes a 25-year-old student, who has their stable values but is still not afraid to experiment with art and technology and always places the human being into the centre of attention. They would be a communicative and collaborative character who is not afraid to take risks, and is always open-minded and welcomes a diversity of all kind of personalities who want to work together with them. ","To be honest, I googled for my internship at the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam “Future-Narrative Austria”. Google led me of course immediately to the Ars Electronica Futurelab that I knew already from various media platforms and people before. I applied at the Lab as an intern at the time of September 2020 with the thought that nobody ever will reply to me. I even sent my application per post and created a magazine about my own artworks from the perspective of me as a journalist. Apparently the Futurelab usually never gets applications per post and they were pretty impressed by that old-fashioned act of mine. Two weeks later I had the application call via Microsoft Teams. I was so afraid that the three directors would be strict, so a watched for a whole day Youtube videos about them holding interviews and lectures to analyze they gesticulate. 
Very quickly after having my Microsoft Teams call and moving to Linz, I realized that the atmosphere in the Futurelab is “not so strict” such as in other companies. And I realized that probably the Futurelab is the only place in the world where you can turn within 1 month from an intern to a project manager.",-,"I wish the lab and its active members to never stop involving more and more creative brains that contribute with their talents to future projects of the Lab.

The constant need for clarification at a young age led him down a path to where science meets art, like the land meets the sea. He studied Multimedia Art at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzburg, majoring in Crossmedia Design. Both in the bachelor and master program he was involved in multiple projects which covered the disciplines film, animation, audio and design. During and after university he dedicated himself to his interest in micro controllers and interactive installations.

Since 2016, Patrick has supported the SwarmOS* Team as a Show Designer at the Ars Electronica Futurelab, where he conceives and animates choreographies for flying & driving swarms of unmanned vehicles. In this context, he is engaged with the potential of swarms as a medium of visual communication. Additionally, he is constantly involved in the development of workflows that bring 3D Animation, interactivity & unmanned vehicles together to create experiences that sometimes succeed at being indistinguishable from magic.

It's a place to try out new concepts, even if they might fail. A place where societal problems are tackled in a collaborative manner. I think it's an institution whose largest commodity is informed, artistic & scientific thinking while actually valuing the disciplines equally. I believe it has done and is doing a great job at not selling out and as long as I know the Futurelab it has really held up its integrity in working towards the betterment of society. ","I was fresh out of uni and looking for a job at the time (2016), but nothing seemed to fit. I studied Multimedia Art in Salzburg and was heavily into the maker movement so I couldn't really identify with the typical client-designer thing. Animating swarms of real-life flying pixels had a much stronger draw for me. So, I jumped into my 3D software for a very intense week, trying to get to grips with particle animation & ended up with some nice drone swarm animations. I think those animations and my enthusiasm for the project is what got me the job.  ","Since I have nearly exclusively been involved with Spaxels, SwarmArena & SwarmOS it it hard to say. What I can say is that the Spaxels have had a massive impact globally, triggering many tech companies to go above and beyond in terms of numbers of drones in the sky. I find that amazing. So far, the focus was on light shows with drones, but the system has incredible potential in many different areas. A potential that can be quite scary but also very inspiring once you start to really think about it.

An essential feature of her work is the direct engagement with the existing spatial and contentual conditions and the theme related appropriation of new cultural techniques for the realization of her works. The physical nature of the materials used, just as the experimental handling style with vastly varying work methods flow consciously in the formation process.

The chosen materials are tested for their possibilities and the relationship between the aspects one can precisely plan and the unforeseen coincidences are time and again newly fathomed out.

At Futurelab, scientists, researchers and artists from all over the world constantly challenge various possibilities, practice creative ideas and open up new visions for the future.","When I was studying at the Interface Culture department, Kunstuniversität Linz, some artists and researchers from Futurelab opened up courses in the department to introduce Futurelab and share their experience and ideas. That was the first time I got to know Futurelab.

Later, when I did the art residency atFuturelab in 2017, I had an opportunity to work with great and intelligent people from Futurelab for a period of time. At that time, I also received a lot of technical support for my artwork from them.
","There are many impressive projects from Futurelab. In my opinion,  ""Future Ink (Bio Ink / AI Ink / Space Ink)"" is one of the maximum impact projects. The work is a joint creation of the Wacom and Futurelab series. Before seeing the work, I had been considering Wacom as just a company that has deep research and development in the drawing interfaces.But
in ""Future Ink"", they have furtherly changed the concept of pen, and explored new concepts of painting. At the same time, they explored the artistic approach and philosophy thinking, such as, Where is soul? Does the noise filtered by the digital system belong to art? and so on. The work combined with many thoughts which I find interesting.
","Because of the covid-19, not only our lives but also the art field are seriously impacted.
In this New Normal, I hope Futurelab can still gather all walks of excellent people to work together and develop new ideas constantly.

The Telegarden was there from 1996-2005.  

More on the Telegarden:
The Telegarden

This art installation allowed anyone on the internet to view and
interact with a remote garden filled with living plants.  Users could
plant, water, and monitor the progress of seedlings via the tender
movements of an industrial robot arm.

The Telegarden was first exhibited at the Interactive Media Festival in   
Los Angeles in August 1995, where it won the Kobe Prize. In August, 1996,
it moved to the Ars Electronica Center in Austria, where it was on exhibit
and available 24 hours a day for eight years (through August 2004).

Often, when people talk about future and innovation, they only think about technology. The Futurelab has a broader understanding of it, and links technology with art and science and sets it in context to society. I feel like it has more of an „educational mission“ and is not as constrained by commercial and marketing factors as agencies are. You can see that in the projects and the outcome, but also in how the people here work together. In addition to the projects, the public image is a big part of it. The networking, the talks, the interviews, the public presence – not just nationally, but especially internationally – is a big part of what the Futurelab is and aims to be. ","I was always drawn to Ars Electronica and everything revolving around it, but I first connected with the Futurelab during my Bachelor studies at St.Pölten University of Applied Sciences. Christopher Lindinger, former co-director of the futurelab, held a lecture at the University and I became intrigued with their work and way of thinking. I wrote my first bachelor thesis about participation in museums under his supervision. After my studies, I lost touch with Linz and gained professional experience further away. But Ars Electronica remained in the back of my head, and finally in 2020 I applied and joined the Futurelab. ","In my opinion, the projects with the most (international) attention are Spaxels and AIxMusic. Both projects were involved with the Festival and/or Klangwolke, which always reach a very big audience. And of course the DeepSpace has had quite an impact entertainment-wise.

During her education, she gained first experiences in the field of project management. Already as of 1999, Anna operated in the environment of Ars Electronica, where she participated in the production of several Cyberarts exhibitions at O.K. – Center for Contemporary Art.

Furthermore, she got involved in various cultural exchange projects with international musicians and artists as well as in projects of development cooperation. After finishing her studies, Anna spent three years in Tanzania where she worked for diverse cultural institutions and in hotel management. In the years 2008/2009 she participated in the management team for the Parade, a project for Linz 2009 European Capital of Culture.

In 2011, Anna worked as a project manager for the Ars Electronica Festival and consequently switched to the Ars Electronica Futurelab where she has been a permanent team member since. She is a senior producer who, in addition to general project management activities, has been responsible for developing content for interactive installations and for managing the Futurelab webpage.",https://formfacade.com/uploaded/1FAIpQLScGUtYaODSgljFqfuXujcv1Ha4_5GgQMzg84REAzBJElErX2Q/-Mh_2ExZ7c0zsWzSIqgG/275325920/MG_4805-683x1024.jpg,The futurelab for me is a bunch of young creative people that can take any idea and make something amazing out of it. I’m always astonished by the creative and productive process from brainstorming and first sketches to the final outcome. ,"My first encounter with the Ars Electronica network was quite early. Already during my secondary education, I spent several summer holidays working to produce the Cyberarts exhibition. The contacts from that time – together with my interests and experience in working in project management - later opened the door for my entry into Ars Electronica. I started working as project manager for the festival, organizing the Themenausstellung for the Ars Electronica Festival 2011. I really enjoyed this task as it was very diverse - from the communication with international artists to the planning of the exhibition architecture.  Hence, I searched for a permanent employment as project manager in the Ars Electronica network. Luckily the Futurelab needed support for the Zeitraum project at Vienna airport. So, I shifted to the Futurelab where I have been working mainly in project management and in recent years additionally in content management.  ",,,,,,

The friends that I made during my time there will be with me for life. It was also the place where I found my direction in terms of my professional career. It allowed me to bring all of the various skills and attributes that I had learnt through my education and practice together into one form. I then honed this form into what is now a successful life that allows me to be financially comfortable and do what I love doing. As the main location and context for my PhD research, it became evident that it is one of the few true examples of a transdisciplinary lab. While such labs become more and more prominent, the Futurelab has stood the test of time and has become a leading example that the new labs aspire to be. The Futurelab shows that you first need to invest into a culture of collaboration that goes well beyond just interdisciplinary teams working together to solve a problem or answer a question. This is what many of the new labs still fail to understand IMO. ","In 2008 I was fortunate enough to join the production team of the new Ars Electronica Center. Through that work I became familiar with the lab and many of its members. Eventually I met the directors, including Horst and they offered me a job. AT first there wasn’t a position existing that would fit my skill set, and so, they invented one. Over the year I wore many hats as an artist, researcher, team leader, media planner and producer. ","Seeing the start and development of the Spaxels was pretty amazing. I would consider this as some what a masterpiece of media art. In 2013 I was the project leader to bring that project to Brisbane, Australia. We had to change aviation laws to make that happen and that was another important milestone to what is nowadays the most highly sort after form of large scale outdoor entertainment – evident by what we saw at the Japan Olympics opening in 2021. When I saw that, it reminded me of what a special place the Futurelab is – to invent such a project through will, belief and for the love of the experiment. Another one would be the Aakash Odedra project Murmur. This to me was a pinnacle example of true transdisciplinary collaboration that begins first in the process of forming a new language and experimentation that is grounded in a sense of play. ","My wish is that the Futurelab continues to lead the way for others, like my own studio in Australia, to follow. Our work is devoted to the principles that I was able to learn at the Futurelab and greater Ars Electronica. Through seeking ways to promote open and transdisciplinary education for all of society, it is my belief that a better world and future is possible.

Her artistic research explores ‘the living’, the evolving perception of what bodies are made of. She investigates the influence scientific knowledge has had on the way we have perceived and interpreted the human body historically and how this affects current society and the cultural contexts in which we act. Sonja uses self-experimentation to question skin as a border of the human body, taking risks by engaging directly with the material and by seeking the points where the environment starts and ends. These spaces in-between are vivid entanglements full of life. They annul trans-species boundaries, revealing as yet unexplored forms of intelligence and communication. 

Most of her projects involve long-term collaborations and extensive fieldwork. She creates process-driven, trans-disciplinary and imaginary, yet tangible microbial landscapes such as living paintings, sculptures, rituals, installations and performances intending to sense and thus better understand what the microbial paradigm shift means for the limits of the self and the relation between self-interest and collective behaviour.  

At the moment, Sonja works as tutor and head of the Jewellery-Linking Bodies Department at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam, as well as lecturing and holding workshops at different national and international academies and universities.

She studied Fashion Design at the Fashion Institute in Vienna, and holds a Bachelor in Arts from the University of Arts in Linz, as well as a Master in Conceptual Design in Context from the Design Academy in Eindhoven. In 2012, she was awarded the Outstanding Artist Award for the Project Textile Anatomy by the BMUKK Federal Ministry of Education, Art and Culture in Vienna.  

Her work has been exhibited internationally at the Ars Electronica Center, the Anthology Film Archives New York, the MAK Museum of Applied Arts, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Taipei, the Museum of Natural History in Vienna, the ZKM Center for Art and Media or the Centre Pompidou Paris. Her projects have also provided the basic impact for documentary films (e.g. BioArt - Kunst aus dem Labor, ORF/ARTE), to which she actively contributed. She is a co-founder of the Dunbar's Number collective (since 2011), a member of the Pavillion35 (since 2012) collective, based in Vienna, and of the WNDRLUST (2013-2018) collective, based in Amsterdam.

Afterwards applied for an Open Call as part of a 3 year European Union FP7 project Studiolab, got selected and developed the project Metabodies together with Manuel Selg at the Future- and Biolab in 2013.","The Living Logic Masterclass organised by the FutureLab had a big impact on us participants as it allowed us to meet, spend time and exchange with the Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nica winners.",Wishes to keep reflecting and questioning the lab's role and it's purpose. Lots of inspiring international artists in residence and FUN!,Metabodies ,Sonja Bäumel and Manuel Selg,https://formfacade.com/uploaded/1FAIpQLScGUtYaODSgljFqfuXujcv1Ha4_5GgQMzg84REAzBJElErX2Q/-MiR9h81S7dOzcj0lmW0/398979033/metabodies_sonja%20baeumel%20and%20manuel%20selg_image_1.jpg,https://www.sonjabaeumel.at/work/metabodies/

That lead me to a university - studying in this field. Enjoyment in game development and the creation of interactive applications and installations induced a strong interest in software development. In my activities in the Futurelab, I can combine all those skills, interests, and experiences.",https://formfacade.com/uploaded/1FAIpQLScGUtYaODSgljFqfuXujcv1Ha4_5GgQMzg84REAzBJElErX2Q/-MiVJSsDc6pJD6KfH4tj/275325920/mimimimi.png,"It is not a monolith. It is as far away from being that as it can be. It is very heterogeneous in its members - their interests and capabilities, as well as in its projects.","During my time at the university, I, together with a fellow student, got the chance to develop a collaborative hybrid VR experience, called Cargo, for the Electronica Festival 2016. At that point, I figured, that I might have to join the Team. About two years later, I got in touch with the Futurelab and did exactly that.","I am aware that I only know about a fraction of the projects. Not to speak of the numerous past projects. However, I'm going to name two. First, the research in AI and more specifically in creativity in AI and AI music. I believe research in that field has the potential to contribute to very interesting discoveries, or at least glimpses, into how parts of our subconsciousness work. To me, it is fascinating, that we try to emulate something, we do not understand in its entirety. To accomplish that, we use technologies that the human mind is less and less able to comprehend.

The second project is the Spaxels - a large-scale pioneering achievement, that has shaped an entire genre. A wonderful example of an innovation-driven commitment to a great idea. The result is the creation of cutting-edge technology and an art form at the same time.",I wish that it stays in motion - that it keeps evolving.,,,https://formfacade.com/uploaded/1FAIpQLScGUtYaODSgljFqfuXujcv1Ha4_5GgQMzg84REAzBJElErX2Q/-MiVJSsDc6pJD6KfH4tj/398979033/mimimimi.png,
