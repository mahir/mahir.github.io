# Interactive Assignment: AI-Powered Startup Sprint

Pick a problem. Write a PRD. Build a prototype. Reflect on how AI shaped your work.

---

## The Assignment

You have **45 minutes** and access to any AI tool you want.

By the end, you'll submit three things:

1. **A PRD** for a product that solves a real problem
2. **A working prototype** built with AI tools
3. **A short reflection** on how AI helped and where it fell short

---

## The One Rule

**You must use AI throughout.** Not as a nice-to-have, as a core part of your workflow.

Use it to research, brainstorm, draft, critique, and build. How you use it is up to you.

You're the PM. AI is your team. Make the calls.

---

# Part 1: The PRD

Find a problem worth solving and write a PRD for it.

---

## Pick a Problem

Choose a domain where you have personal experience, something you have opinions about and understand deeply.

Use AI to explore the space. Ask it what problems exist, who's underserved, what solutions are failing. Challenge its answers with what you actually know.

Then commit to one problem and one target user.

---

## Write the PRD

A good PRD answers these questions:

- **What problem are you solving?** Be specific. Describe it in the user's words.
- **Who is the target user?** Not a demographic. A person with a behavior and a pain point.
- **What does the product do?** The core flow in 3-5 steps.
- **How will you know it's working?** Goals, metrics, targets.
- **What are you building in v1?** Requirements, user stories, scope.
- **What are you NOT building?** Just as important.
- **What could go wrong?** Risks and how you'd handle them.

Use AI to draft, structure, and pressure-test your PRD. Edit it until it reflects your judgment, not just the AI's output.

## Suggested AI Prompts

These are starting points. Adapt them or write your own.

```
I'm exploring problems in [domain]. What are
5 underserved problems that existing solutions
handle poorly?
```

```
Help me draft a one-page PRD for [product].
Here's what I know: [paste your context].
Structure it and push back where it's vague.
```

```
Review this PRD. What's missing? What assumptions
am I making? Where would an engineer or designer
push back?
```

---

# Part 2: The Prototype

Build something real that demonstrates your core idea.

---

## Pick Your Tool

Use whatever gets you to a working prototype fastest:

- **Bolt / Lovable**: describe your app, get a deployed prototype
- **v0.dev**: generate UI components from text
- **Replit**: AI-assisted coding in your browser
- **Claude / ChatGPT**: generate code to run locally

You can build a landing page, a functional single-screen app, or a clickable multi-screen prototype. Your choice. The goal is something you can show to another person.

---

# Part 3: Reflection

Step back from the work and think about the process.

---

## Answer These Questions

**Where did AI help the most?** Which parts of the PM workflow got faster or better with AI?

**Where was AI weak or wrong?** What did it generate that you had to fix, override, or throw away?

**What required your judgment?** What decisions could only you make, things the AI couldn't do for you?

**What would you do differently next time?** How would you change your approach to using AI?

---

# What to Submit

---

## Your Deliverables

1. **PRD**: as a doc or PDF
2. **Prototype**: a deployed link or screenshots
3. **Reflection**: written answers to the four questions above (a few sentences each is fine)

---

> The AI didn't make a single decision. You did.
>
> That's the job.
