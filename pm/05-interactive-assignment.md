# Interactive Assignment: 45-Minute Startup Sprint

You have 45 minutes to go from zero to a startup concept with a PRD, roadmap, go-to-market plan, and working prototype.

---

## The Twist

**You must use AI throughout this exercise.**

This isn't just about building a startup—it's about experiencing how AI changes the PM workflow.

You'll use AI to brainstorm, draft, build, and pressure-test.

---

## What You'll Create

By the end of this sprint:

- A clear problem statement and target user
- A product vision and competitive positioning
- A one-page PRD
- A 3-month roadmap
- A go-to-market narrative
- A working prototype built with AI
- A pressure-tested pitch

---

## Rules of Engagement

1. **AI is required, not optional.** Each section has specific AI prompts.
2. **You're the PM, not the AI.** AI generates options; you make decisions.
3. **Timebox ruthlessly.** When time's up, move on.
4. **Constraints are real.** Treat resource limits as hard constraints.

---

## Setup

Open your AI tool (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) in a separate window.

**Paste this starter context:**

```
I'm doing a 45-minute startup sprint exercise.
Help me brainstorm, draft, and pressure-test
ideas. Be concise—I'm on a timer. Push back
when my ideas are vague or weak. I want useful
critique, not cheerleading.
```

Review the output. Did it surface anything you hadn't considered?

---

## Define Your User & Problem

**Target user** (one sentence — include a behavior, not just a demographic):

**Bad:** "Young professionals"

**Good:** "First-time managers (promoted in last 6 months) at companies with no management training"

---

## AI Task: PRD Draft

Ask your AI:

*"Help me draft a one-page PRD for [product name]. Here's what I have: [paste problem, user, solution, MVP scope]. Structure it for me."*

Review and edit the output.

## Make It Real

Use AI coding tools to build a working prototype that demonstrates your core idea.

**Tools you can use:**

*"I need to build a quick prototype of [product]. The core flow is: [paste 3-5 step flow]. Generate a working [web app / landing page / mockup]. Keep it minimal—10 minute build."*

---

## Pick One to Build

**Option A: Interactive Landing Page** — Hero with one-liner, visual or demo of core value, email capture for waitlist

**Option B: Functional MVP** — Single-screen app that does the ONE thing. Hardcode what you need to.

**Option C: Clickable Prototype** — 3-5 screens showing user flow. Doesn't need real functionality.

# What This Exercise Teaches

---

## About Startups

- Decisions made quickly can be changed; decisions not made cannot
- Specificity beats vagueness at every stage
- A prototype is worth 1000 PRD pages
- Constraints force creativity

---

## About AI as a PM Tool

- AI drafts; you decide
- AI accelerates brainstorming, structuring, and building
- AI pressure-tests miss emotional and organizational context
- Output quality depends on how you prompt

---

> You built a startup concept with PRD, roadmap, GTM, and working prototype in 45 minutes.
>
> The AI didn't make a single decision—you did.
>
> That's the job.
