# AI's Impact on Product Management

AI isn't just another technology trend. It's reshaping how products are built, what users expect, and what PMs need to know.

---

## The AI Shift for PMs

Before we dive in, let's be real about what's happening.

---

**The hype:** AI will replace PMs. AI will do everything. Every product needs AI.

**The reality:** AI is a powerful tool that amplifies PM capabilities, creates new opportunities, and introduces new challenges.

It won't replace good product thinking, but it will reward PMs who learn to use it effectively.

---

## Why This Matters Now

A few things have converged:

1. **AI capabilities have crossed usability thresholds.** LLMs can now do useful things reliably enough to ship to users.

2. **AI is accessible.** You don't need a PhD or an ML team. APIs exist.

---

3. **User expectations are shifting.** After ChatGPT, users expect products to understand them, adapt to them, and help them intelligently.

4. **Competitive pressure is real.** If you're not thinking about AI in your product, your competitors are.

---

## AI as a PM Tool

AI can make you more effective across your core workflow. We'll cover specific tools in the next module. Here's the high-level picture.

---

### Where AI Helps Most Today

- **Research & synthesis**: Upload transcripts, find patterns in minutes instead of days
- **Writing**: First drafts of PRDs, specs, and comms. Rewriting for different audiences
- **Data analysis**: Natural language queries, anomaly detection, instant summaries
- **Prototyping**: Working mockups and code prototypes from descriptions

---

### Where AI Falls Short

- **Strategic judgment**: AI can help you think, but can't tell you what's important
- **Organizational context**: It doesn't know your company's politics or culture
- **User intuition**: It hasn't met your users
- **Accountability**: AI doesn't own outcomes; you do

---

> Use AI to go faster on the work that's formulaic. Invest the time saved into the work that requires human insight.

---

## AI Product Strategy

Beyond individual features, how should you think about AI strategically?

---

## Build vs Buy vs Partner

For AI capabilities, you have three paths.

---

### Build (Train Your Own Models)

- Full control and differentiation
- Requires ML expertise, data, infrastructure
- High cost, long timelines

**Makes sense when:** AI is core to your differentiation, you have unique data

---

### Buy (Use AI APIs)

- Fast to implement, no ML expertise needed
- Vendor lock-in, less differentiation
- Variable costs, dependency on vendor roadmap

**Makes sense when:** AI is a feature, not the product

---

### Partner

- Middle ground on control and investment
- Requires negotiation and relationship management

**Makes sense when:** Strategic alignment exists, scale matters

---

> Most products should start with buy (APIs), then consider build if AI becomes core to differentiation.

---

## Evaluating AI Opportunities

Not everything needs AI. Here's how to evaluate.

---

### Good Candidates for AI

- Tasks that are tedious and repetitive
- Decisions requiring lots of information synthesis
- Personalization at scale
- Content creation where "good enough" is valuable
- Anything requiring expensive human expertise

---

### Bad Candidates for AI

- Tasks where errors are unacceptable
- Simple interactions that work fine with traditional UX
- Where users want control, not automation
- Cases where you can't explain or audit AI decisions
- Features where AI novelty is the only value

---

### Evaluation Questions

1. What problem does AI solve that couldn't be solved otherwise?
2. What's the cost of AI being wrong?
3. Do users want this, or are we just excited about AI?
4. Can we get the data needed for good performance?
5. Does this align with our product strategy?

---

## Competitive Moats in the AI Era

If everyone has access to the same foundation models, what's defensible?

---

### Data Moats

- Unique data improves your AI performance
- User-generated data creates flywheel effects
- Proprietary data sources are hard to replicate

---

### Workflow Integration

- Deep integration into user workflows is sticky
- It's not just the AI. It's the context around it
- Switching costs compound over time

---

### Speed and Execution

- Being first matters less than being best
- Fast iteration with user feedback builds advantage
- Ship, learn, improve faster than competitors

---

### Specialized AI

- Fine-tuned models for your domain
- Prompt engineering and tooling expertise
- Human-in-the-loop workflows optimized over time

---

### Brand and Trust

- Trust is hard to build, easy to lose
- Responsible AI practices become differentiators
- Users remember bad AI experiences

---

> Moats are harder in the AI era. The technology commoditizes quickly.
>
> Your defensibility comes from everything *around* the AI: data, integration, trust, execution.

---

## Skills PMs Need to Develop

What should you learn to PM effectively in the AI era?

---

## Prompt Engineering Basics

You don't need to be an expert, but you should understand the fundamentals.

---

### Context Setting

LLMs perform better with context. Tell it who it is, what it knows, what you want.

```
You are a product manager reviewing a PRD.
You have 10 years of experience and are known
for finding edge cases. Review this PRD and
identify potential issues.
```

---

### Specificity

Vague prompts get vague outputs. Be specific about format, length, style, and content.

```
Write a 3-bullet executive summary of this
document. Each bullet should be one sentence.
Focus on business impact.
```

---

### Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)

Show the LLM what you want by giving examples.

```
Convert these user requests into user stories:

Request: "I want to see my order history"
User story: "As a customer, I want to view my
past orders so that I can track my purchases."

Request: "Let me pay with Apple Pay"
User story: [LLM completes]
```

---

### Chain of Thought

For complex reasoning, ask the LLM to think step by step.

```
Analyze this competitive landscape. First,
list the main competitors. Then, for each,
identify strengths and weaknesses. Finally,
summarize the opportunities for our product.
```

---

## Understanding ML Fundamentals

You don't need to build models, but you should collaborate effectively.

---

### Model Types

- **Classification:** Categorizes inputs (spam/not spam)
- **Regression:** Predicts values (house price)
- **Generative:** Creates new content (text, images)
- **Recommendation:** Suggests relevant items

---

### Trade-offs to Understand

- Accuracy vs speed
- Model size vs cost
- Customization vs maintenance burden
- Accuracy vs explainability

---

### What This Means for PMs

- You can ask intelligent questions about model performance
- You can set reasonable expectations
- You can define success metrics that make sense
- You can avoid impossible requests ("100% accuracy")

---

## The Future of PM

What stays the same? What changes?

---

## What Stays the Same

**User focus:** Technology changes; human needs don't.

**Strategic thinking:** AI automates tactics, not strategy.

**Cross-functional leadership:** Building products requires coordinating humans.

**Ownership:** Someone needs to own outcomes. AI doesn't take responsibility.

---

## What Changes

**Speed expectations:** When AI does in minutes what took hours, stakeholders expect faster turnaround.

**New skill requirements:** Understanding AI capabilities, evaluating outputs, designing for uncertainty.

**Time allocation:** Less routine tasks, more judgment-heavy work.

**Product complexity:** AI features are harder to test, explain, and predict.

---

## Wrapping Up

AI is the biggest shift in product building since the smartphone. It changes what's possible, what users expect, and what skills PMs need.

But the fundamentals endure. Great products still solve real problems for real people. Great PMs still drive outcomes through influence, not authority.

---

> The best PMs in the AI era won't be the ones who know the most about AI.
>
> They'll be the ones who use AI to amplify their product judgment, user empathy, and strategic thinking.
