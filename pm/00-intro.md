## Why This Course?

AI is reshaping product management, not replacing (?) it, but transforming how we work.

The PMs who thrive will be those who understand both *the fundamentals* and *what's changing*.

## Who This Is For

Most probably you know about the PM role. Most probably you've shipped products. And maybe you've run sprints, written PRDs, and navigated stakeholder politics.

This isn't PM 101.

This is about **leveling up**: understanding the craft at a deeper level and adapting to the AI era. And having fun!

The best PMs are learning machines.

They reflect on what worked and what didn't. They study the craft. They adapt.

You're already on this path.

*Let's go.*
